# What Is OpenStack? 
## Build Your Own Cloud from Scratch

Most of us rely on cloud services like AWS or Azure without really thinking about what’s going on underneath. But what if you could build something similar yourself? That’s where **OpenStack** comes in—an open-source platform that lets you create your own cloud infrastructure.

Whether you're a student, developer, or sysadmin, OpenStack is a great way to understand cloud computing from the ground up.

## Why Choose OpenStack?

- **Open-source and customizable**
- **No vendor lock-in**
- **Modular architecture—you use only what you need**
- **Ideal for learning cloud internals and experimenting**

It’s a great playground for learning and prototyping your own private or hybrid cloud setup.

## Key Components 

Here are the core building blocks of OpenStack:

- **Nova** – Handles VM provisioning (compute service)
- **Neutron** – Manages networking
- **Glance** – Stores and manages VM images
- **Cinder** – Provides block storage for instances
- **Horizon** – Web UI dashboard for managing everything
- **Keystone** – Authenticates users and services
- **Swift** – Object storage for large-scale data
- **Heat** – Automates resource deployment with templates
- **Ceilometer** – Tracks usage and metrics

You don’t need to use them all—just pick what fits your project.

## Getting Started

**Minimum requirements for a test setup**:
- 32GB RAM, multi-core CPU, SSD storage

**Deployment methods**:
- **DevStack** – Quick setup for testing and learning
- **RDO/Packstack** – One-command install on RHEL-based systems
- **OpenStack-Ansible** – For production-ready, customizable deployments

DevStack is a great entry point. It sets everything up with a few commands on Ubuntu or CentOS.

## A Real-World Use Case: Kubernetes on OpenStack

Want to go further? You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster inside OpenStack:

1. Launch VMs for control and worker nodes
2. Configure networking with Neutron
3. Install Kubernetes with `kubeadm`
4. Deploy workloads like NGINX or custom apps

This is how many real-world private cloud environments operate.
